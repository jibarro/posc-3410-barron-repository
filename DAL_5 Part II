# Title: POSC-3410 DAL 5 Part II ####
# Author: Jake Barron
# Date 03/12/2021


# Purpose: To learn how to do chi-square tests on the GSS File.

# set up ####
# Libaries
library(tidyverse)
library(stringer)
library(infer)

# Data 
load("DALs/Lecture 13 - Probability IV/data/gss_df.Rdata")

# Theory: Support of science and technology --> Views on space exploration

# Theoretical Null Hypothesis: A person's views on science and technology gives more opportunities to the next generation (nextgen) are NOT related to their views on supporting space exploration (intspace).

# Theoretical Alternative Hypothesis: A person's views on science and technology gives more opportunities to the next generation (nextgen) are related to their views on supporting space exploration (intspace).

# Statistical Tests
# nextgen = IV = categorical variable, non-interval = 2 independent groups (agree and disagree) <- this will require some work

# intspace = DV = categorical variable, non-interval = 2 or more categories 

# get data in shape for analysis ####
# what do you think we will have to do to the rows? To the columns?

# Do we want something that looks roughly like this?

  # keep only vars we need
  select(INTSPACE, NEXTGEN, WTSSALL) %>%
