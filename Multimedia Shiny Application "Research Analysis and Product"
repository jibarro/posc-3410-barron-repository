      p("Hypotheses: This study is designed to assess the hypothesis that the location/region is the most influential factor in determining casualty numbers and choice of targets. 
      Potential Outcomes of Analysis:
	1. Reject Hypotheses  
This would determine that a variable other then Location is the most influential factor in determining casualty numbers and choice of targets. 
	2. Not Reject Hypotheses
This would result in the variable Location being the most influential factor in determining casualty numbers and choice of targets. 
	3. Not Enough Data to make a Conclusion
This result would determine that more information is needed to adequately address the claims made within the hypotheses.  

"),
      p("Research Design: 

Explanatory Variables: Region/Location of Attack

Explained Variables: Casualty Numbers & Choice of Targets

Control Variables: 
Attacks endorsed by recognized terror groups
Population Index of country suffering attack
Method of Attack

Validity of Observational Time Series:
Internal Validity: Neutral

External Validity Strong +

Feasibility: Neutral

Data Collection Method: Observational collection of numerical data

Data Summary: Terrorist Attacks from 1970-2019
	This data set will provide adequate information to determine whether or not the hypothesis is true.  

"),
      p("Interpretation 
Hypothesis Status: 
Based on the results of my statistical analysis, I reject my Null hypothesis with 99% confidence. 

What Does This Result Mean 


[Chi-square]
X and Y are related. X and Y are related. In the instance of a 1 unit change in the x axis there is a %change in the y axis.  This %change will vary depending upon the region.   
"),
      p("Analytical Conclusion: Based upon the interpretation of the statistical tests we can conclude that there is a relationship between the location of terrorist attacks and the resulting casualty numbers.  We were able to reject the null hypothesis which stated that, “Location is not the most influential factor in determining casualty numbers and choice of targets” because once we ran our statistical tests the p-value was      < .01.  We failed to reject the alternative hypothesis and can conclude that there is a relationship between the location of terrorist attacks and the casualties produced.  
"),
      p("Next Steps in Research Agenda: Through understanding what types of terrorists attacks are most likely to result in the highest number of casualties, national governments can be proactive in preventing such attacks from occurring and limiting the destruction they incur upon their people.   

Countries / Regions that are at high risk for such activity can take steps to deter terrorism within their borders.
